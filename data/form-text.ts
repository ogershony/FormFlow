export const FINANCIAL_POLICY = `As a courtesy to you, we will be happy to file your claim with your employee benefit plan.

At your request, we can offer a Pre-Treatment Estimate from your benefits plan. A Pre-Treatment Estimate does not mean, however, that your benefit plan will guarantee payment. The payment is subject to plan provisions and eligibility at the times services are actually rendered.

We accept cash, checks, Visa and MasterCard. We also offer third-party, no interest financing through Care Credit.

Also as a courtesy, we will try to provide you with estimates (not quotes) for your dental work. The benefits estimated are not guaranteed. If for any reason your insurance does not pay for your dental work, it is your responsibility to pay the remaining balance on your account regardless of any estimates we may have provided.

Payment Options:
• Hygiene and all other minor visits: we will ask for your portion on the date of service
• Crowns, Bridges, Dentures, Implants: a 50% deposit is required at the 1st appointment and the remaining balance will be due on or before the seat date/final appointment

Cancellation Policy:
We reserve your appointment time exclusively for you. Should you find it necessary to make a change to your scheduled appointment, we request you call our office during business hours at least 2 business days (Monday-Thursday) prior to your appointment. This allows us to contact other patients in need of care who would like a sooner appointment. There is a minimum charge of $75 for appointments broken without 2 business days notice.`
